<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there, <br />

  I'm Elbert, and if you're curious about the person behind the name, 
  here's a little sneak peek into my world.
  By day, I'm a Software Developer, diving into programming and loving every bit of the challenge. 
  I've got 1 years of experience under my belt, 
  and let me tell you, it's been one heck of a ride.
  </p>

<p>But there's more to me than just work. Outside the office, I'm all about gamer. 
  Whether it's spent a lot of time to play a games and hangout with my girfriend or bros, 
  you'll find me in my element.</p>

<p>What keeps me going? Well, I'm a firm believer in religion as a Catholic. 
  It's the compass guiding my decisions and keeping me on track, both professionally and personally.
  Looking ahead, I've got my sights set on to be succeed, and I'm excited about the journey ahead.
  If you're into programming, gaming, hangout and take a drink, 
  or if you just want to grab a coffee and chat about life, I'm all ears. Drop me a line, 
  and let's connect!
